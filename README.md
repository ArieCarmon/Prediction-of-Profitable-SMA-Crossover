This repository contains the following files:
  1. Profitable_Trades_Predictions_by_MA50_MA200_Crossovers_V2.ipynb: Jupyter Notbook file which is the main code of the project - processing the data and selecting the model
  2. Profitable_Trades_Predictions_by_MA50_MA200_Crossovers_Appendix_V3.ipynb: Jupyter Notbook file which is an appendix to test the statistical significance of the model's results
  3. sp500_daily_ratios_20yrs.zip: This is the source dataset from which the datasets used for the model and the appendix were derived
  4. clean_crosse_df.csv: This file is created and saved during the processes in the main file
  5. appendix_cross_df.xlsx: An Excel file prepared for the appendix - more detailed description is in the Intoduction part of the Appendix

So, the recommended order to view the project is obviously by starting with the main code file and following the documentation inside it.
